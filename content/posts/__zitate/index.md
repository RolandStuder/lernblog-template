> When I left Hawaii, I lost everything. I had a stable life, stable love, family, future. And I lost that life, but, I've gained a new one, and I am incredibly fortunate. And I think the greatest freedom that I've gained is the fact that I no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow, because I'm happy with what I've done today."
